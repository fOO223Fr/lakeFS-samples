[ Description: ] The Morrow Plots at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are the longest-running continuous experimental plots in the Americas. In continuous operation since 1876, the plots were established to explore the impact of crop rotation and soil treatment on corn crop yields. In 2018, The Morrow Plots Data Curation Working Group began to identify, collect and curate the various data records created over the history of the experiment. The resulting data table published here includes planting, treatment and yield data for the Morrow Plots since 1888. Please see the included codebook for a detailed explanation of the data sources and their content. This dataset will be updated as new yield data becomes available.
