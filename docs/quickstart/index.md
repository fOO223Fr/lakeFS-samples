## Run lakeFS locally

### [Install lakeFS using Docker](installing.html)
This installation is for learning purposes. This installation will not persist your data. Instead, it will spin-up a database in a docker container, which will be discarded later.

Watch video to install lakeFS using Docker as well as point it to your own object storage:
