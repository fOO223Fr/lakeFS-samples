# Write-Audit-Publish (WAP)

Write-Audit-Publish (WAP) is a pattern in data engineering to give greater control over data quality. It was popularised by Netflix back in 2017 in a talk by [Michelle Winters](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mufford/) at the DataWorks Summit called "[*Whoops the Numbers are wrong! Scaling Data Quality @ Netflix*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXHdeBnpXrg)". 

These notebooks can be used to experiment with the pattern implementations in different technologies.
